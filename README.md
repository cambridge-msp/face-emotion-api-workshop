# Emotion API Workshop

This is a simple app designed to showcase the capabilities of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion
API. It is being used as part of the Cambridge University Microsoft Student Partners' workshop on
the Emotion APIs.

## Workshop Version

This repository contains two branches. `master` contains a fully working implementation of the app. The
`workshop` branch contains gaps in the code which are suitable for being filled in during a workshop
to demonstrate how easy it is to integrate Emotion API into apps. It is deliberately designed to ensure
that it requires no knowledge of Android by ensuring the Android specific parts are already specified.

The original presentation is being given by Henry Thompson and David Adeboye on Friday February 24th 2017.
